This is an implementation of the PHYM3 programming language written in Rust.

This uses the unstable features slice patterns, and requires the nightly build:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/nightly-rust.html

Then build it and run it with cargo as it uses the Sexp Crate:
cargo build
cargo run [PHYM3]
cargo test

ex:
cargo run "(+ 2 4)"
